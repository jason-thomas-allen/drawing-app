Drawing program


Requirement

You are to implement a terminal-based drawing program that can support a range of commands:


C x y - Initialise a canvas of width x and height y. Output the canvas bordered on top and bottom with hyphens ('-'), and on left and right with pipe ('|'). See example output below.

L x1 y1 x2 y2 c - Draws a line between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The line will be drawn with an the given c character.

R x1 y1 x2 y2 c - Draws a rectangle bounded by points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The rectangle will be drawn with the given c character.

B x1 y1 c - Bucket fills all points connected to the point (x1,y1) with the given c color. If filling inside a rectangle, the inside of the rectangle will be marked with the new color.

Q - quits the program

Output

Print the canvas to the screen, bordered on all 4 sides with - and | characters. e.g. a 3x3 canvas (created with the command C 3 3): 

    -----
    |   |
    |   |
    |   |
    -----

Draw a line: L 2 2 3 2 .

-----
|   |
| ..|
|   |
-----

Example command sequence

C 5 10
L 0 0 0 5 x
R 0 0 5 5 y
R 1 1 6 6 z
B 3 3 z .
B 0 1 y ,
Q

Acceptance criteria

- The program will prompt for input, and render the response to the screen, before prompting for more input, up to the point it is terminated with “Q”.
- A readme explaining how to run the code
- Adequate test coverage. We recommend a test-driven approach
- Where requirements are unclear, make a choice and document if necessary
